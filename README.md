## Get started with the code

1. First you need to pip install tensorflow==1.15 and pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15 in Google Colab environment because by default Google Colab uses tensorflow 2.X (some changes on version 2.X cause problems with our code)

2. Open the notebook with Google Colab

3. Change to GPU mode and run it (it may take an hour to run the notebook)
